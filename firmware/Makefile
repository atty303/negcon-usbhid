# This is a prototype Makefile. Modify it according to your needs.
# You should at least check the settings for
# DEVICE ....... The AVR device you compile for
# CLOCK ........ Target AVR clock rate in Hertz
# OBJECTS ...... The object files created from your source files. This list is
#                usually the same as the list of source files with suffix ".o".
# PROGRAMMER ... Options to avrdude which define the hardware you use for
#                uploading to the AVR and the interface where this hardware
#                is connected.
# FUSES ........ Parameters for avrdude to flash the fuses appropriately.

DEVICE     = atmega88p
CLOCK      = 12800000
PROGRAMMER = -c diecimila -P ft0 -B 38400
OBJECTS    = main.o \
	usbdrv.o usbdrvasm.o oddebug.o
FUSES      = -U hfuse:w:0xdf:m -U lfuse:w:0xe2:m
# ATMega88p fuse bits (fuse bits for other devices are different!):
# Example for 8 MHz internal oscillator
# Fuse high byte:
# 0xdf = 1 1 0 1   1 1 1 1 <-- BODLEVEL0
#        ^ ^ ^ ^   ^ ^ ^------ BODLEVEL1
#        | | | |   | +-------- BODLEVEL2
#        | | | |   +---------- EESAVE (set to 0 to preserve EEPROM over chip erase)
#        | | | +-------------- WDTON
#        | | +---------------- SPIEN (if set to 1, serial programming is disabled)
#        | +------------------ DWEN
#        +-------------------- RSTDISBL (if set to 0, RESET pin is disabled)
# Fuse low byte:
# 0xe2 = 1 1 1 0   0 0 1 0
#        ^ ^ \ /   \--+--/
#        | |  |       +------- CKSEL 3..0 (8M internal RC)
#        | |  +--------------- SUT 1..0 (slowly rising power)
